# I.D.E.A. VR Experience

My first DECA project was about bringing virtual reality into education. I created this demo as an example of what a student may experience with virtual reality in a classroom.

You can view some of the source code here:
- [PlanetRing.cs](/Assets/PlanetRing.cs)

> This game uses hand tracking, so not all headsets will be compatible.

## APK File

This comes with a file named [I.D.E.A. VR Experience.apk](</I.D.E.A. VR Experience.apk>), and this file can be downloaded and used with SideQuest to be ported to an Oculus Quest virtual reality headset.

You can find out how to download SideQuest [here](https://github.com/SideQuestVR/SideQuest).

> Note: SideQuest only works with the Oculus Quest, Oculus Quest 2, and OculusQuest 3. For the Oculus Rift or non-oculus headsets, different download methods must be used, and the APK file may not be compatible.
